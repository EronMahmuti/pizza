# OrderPizza 
## _REACT.js_




In this project, I made a web application to order pizza with ingredients you want. This was my very first react project which I built when components were built with classes.  While working on this project I learned a lot about React.js especially how to use useState and how components work.(This project was built with React.js version 17.0.0)
