# OrderPizza 
## _REACT.js_




In this project, I made a web application to order pizza with ingredients you want. This was my very first react project which I built when components were built with classes.  While working on this project I learned a lot about React.js especially how to use useState and how components work.

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript 
- React.js


## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:EronMahmuti/pizza.git
